"""Ghidra functions exposed as MCP resources.

Why resources and not just tools: a client caches a `resources/read` by URI and drops
that cache entry when the server sends `notifications/resources/updated` for it. So a
re-read after a write costs nothing until the server says the content moved — which is
what removes the write→re-read churn. Reads also arrive through the client's own built-in
read-only resource tool, so one permission grant covers reading every function instead of
a rule per Ghidra tool.

Shape, and why it is not symmetrical:

* ``resources/list`` carries exactly one entry, ``ghidra://programs``. It is the discovery
  root: it names every open program and spells out how to build the other URIs.
* everything else is a **template**. Templates never appear in ``resources/list`` (the SDK
  lists them only under ``resources/templates/list``) and ``list_resources`` has no cursor,
  so enumerating one resource per function is not merely impractical at 25k+ functions,
  it is unreachable. Per-function labels therefore live in the ``functions`` index rows and
  in the bundle body — a ``resources/read`` result carries only uri/mimeType/text, with no
  name field to put them in.

Bodies are shaped for the thing that reads them, not for symmetry: the function bundle
is **Markdown** (a resource body travels inside a JSON string, so JSON there arrives at the
model doubly escaped — see ``render.py`` for the measurement), while the row-shaped index
and search bodies stay JSON but compact and without a per-row ``uri``, which was a third of
the index payload and is derivable from the ``uri_template`` they carry.

URI keys are **addresses, never names**. Renaming is the most common write, and a
name-keyed URI would die exactly when its content changes: the client's cached body would
be stranded at the old name with no notification able to reach it, since
``resources/list_changed`` evicts only listings and MCP has no rename notification.
