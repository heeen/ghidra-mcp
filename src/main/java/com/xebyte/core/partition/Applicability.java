/**
 * A partitioner's own answer to "can I run here, and how much would I cover?".
 *
 * <p>The cascade probes before it partitions because <em>which strategy works is
 * binary-specific</em>, and measurably so: RTTI covered 1.6% of a Windows driver
 * (all of it CRT internals) and 0% of two firmware images; MMIO pages covered 23%
 * of an ARM firmware and produced nothing but noise on the same driver. A fixed
 * priority order would apply whichever strategy happened to be first rather than
 * whichever one has evidence.
 *
 * <p>{@code reason} is printed verbatim into the checkout's {@code index.md} when
 * a strategy is skipped, so it must read as an explanation and not a status code.
 *
 * @since 7.2.0
