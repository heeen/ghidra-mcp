/**
 * Lays a compartment's blocks, in address order, out into its {@code .c} files: the one rule
 * for how a tree is split into files, used by the sweep (as it decompiles) and by the
 * reconciler (re-packing a compartment after blocks changed, came or went).
 *
 * <p>The reconciler used to keep its own layout logic, inserting into the file whose range
 * covered the address, splitting a file that grew past the budget, renaming one whose first
 * function changed. That is a second answer to the sweep's question, and the two drifted:
 * after edits a reconciled compartment was split differently from the sweep of the same
 * program. Packing every time from the blocks means one answer.
 *
 * <p>The rule: bytes, not function count, decide a split (median C is ~386 B, max 23 KB, so a
 * fixed count swings between ~8 KB and ~460 KB files), with {@link #MAX_FUNCTIONS_PER_FILE} as
 * a backstop. A file closes BEFORE the block that would overflow it, so the budget is a hard
 * Read ceiling; an empty file takes any block, so an oversized function gets a file of its own
 * and is never split. A file is named for its first function.
